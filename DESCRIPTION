Description: The 'tidyverse' is awesome, but can take a bit to compile on systems
    where there are no pre-built binary packages. Methods are provided which use
    the facilities of the 'usethis' package to snap-in base versions of useful
    'tidyverse' functions that are mostly equivalent (some are more complete
    than others). The base R counterpart functions will likely be slower than
    the 'tidyverse' equivalents but using them will decrease 'Imports' 
    dependencies. Use deliberately and with caution.
